    <abstract>
      <t>This document specifies a chunking protocol for dividing a user payload
      into CCNx Content Objects. This includes specification for the naming convention to use for
      the chunked payload
      and a field added to a Content Object to represent the last chunk of an object.  </t>

    </abstract>
  </front>

  <middle>
     <section title="Introduction">
       <t>CCNx Content Objects <xref target="CCNSemantics"></xref> are sized to amortize cryptographic operations over
       user data while simultaneously staying a reasonable size for transport over today's networks.
       This means a Content Object is usually within common UDP or jumbo Ethernet size.
       If a publisher has a larger amount of data to associate with a single Name, the data should be
       chunked with this chunking protocol.  This protocol uses state in
       the Name and in an optional field within the Content Object.  A chunked object may also have
       an external metadata content object that describes the original pre-chunked object.</t>

      <t>CCNx uses two types of messages: Interests and Content Objects <xref target="CCNSemantics"></xref>.
        An Interest carries the
        hierarchically structured variable-length identifier (HSVLI), or Name, of a
        Content Object and serves as a request for that object. If a network element sees multiple
        Interests for the same name, it may aggregate those Interests. A network element along the
        path of the Interest with a matching Content Object may return that object, satisfying the
        Interest. The Content Object follows the reverse path of the Interest to the origin(s) of
        the Interest. A Content Object contains the Name, the object's Payload, and the cryptographic
        information used to bind the Name to the payload. </t>

      <t>This specification adds a new segment to the Name TLV for conveying the chunk number.
        It updates <xref target="CCNMessages"></xref>.
       It also provides guidelines for the usage of the Key Locator in chunked objects.</t>

       <t>Packets are represented as 32-bit wide words using ASCII art.  Because
      of the TLV encoding and optional fields or sizes, there is no concise
      way to represent all possibilities.  We use the convention that ASCII art
      fields enclosed by vertical bars "|" represent exact bit widths.  Fields
      with a forward slash "/" are variable bitwidths, which we typically pad
      out to word alignment for picture readability.</t>

      <section title="Requirements Language">
        <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD
          NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as
          described in <xref target="RFC2119">RFC 2119</xref>.</t>

    <section anchor="protocol" title="Chunking">
      <t>Chunking, as used in this specification, means serializing user data
        into one or more chunks, each encapsulated in a CCNx Content Object.
        A chunk is a contiguous byte range within the user data.
        One segment in the Name of that Content Object represents the chunk number.
        A field in the Content Object - only mandatory in the final chunk - represents the end of
      the stream.  Chunks are denoted
      by a serial counter, beginning at 0 and incrementing by 1 for each
      contiguous chunk.  The chunking ends at the final chunk.  No valid
      user data exists beyond the final chunk, and reading beyond the final
      chunk MUST NOT return any user data.</t>

      <t>Chunking MUST use a fixed block size, where only the final chunk MAY
        use a smaller block size.  This is required to allow a reader to seek
        to a specific byte offset once it knows the block size.
        The blocksize may be inferred from the size of the first chunk of user data.
        The first chunk of user
        data may not be chunk 0.</t>

      <t>Because of the requirement for a fixed block size, the inclusion of certain cryptographic
      fields in the same content objects as user data would throw off the ability to seek.
      Therefore, it is RECOMMENDED that all required cryptographic data, such as public keys
      or key name links, be included in the leading chunks before the first byte of user data.
      User data SHOULD then run continuously and with the same block size through the remainder
      of the content objects.</t>

      <t>This draft introduces a new Name path segment TLV type, called
        the ChunkNumber name segment.
        The ChunkNumber name segment is the serial order of the chunks.  It MUST begin at 0
        and MUST be incremented by 1.
      The ChunkNumber name segment is appended to the base name of the
      user data, and is usually the last name segment.</t>

      <t>The new Content Object field is the EndChunkNumber.
      It MUST be included in the Content Object which is the last chunk of user data, but SHOULD be
      present at the earliest time it is known.  The value of the EndChunkNumber
      should be the network byte order value of the last ChunkNumber.
      For example, if 3000 bytes of user data is split with a 1200 byte block size,
      there will be 3 chunks: 0, 1, and 2.  The EndChunkNumber is 2.</t>

      <t>The EndChunkNumber may be updated in later Chunks to a larger value,
        as long as it has not yet reached the end.
      The EndChunkNumber SHOULD NOT decrease.  If a publisher wishes to close
      a stream before reaching the End Chunk, it should publish empty Content
      Objects to fill out to the maximum EndChunkNumber ever published.
      These padding chunks MUST contain the true EndChunkNumber.</t>

      <section anchor="crypto" title="Cryptographic material">
        <t>Chunk 0 SHOULD include the public key or key name link used to verify the chunked data.
          It is RECOMMENDED to use the same key for the whole set of chunked data.
          If a publisher uses multiple keys, then the public key or key name link for all
          keys SHOULD be in the leading chunks before any user data.
        </t>

        <t>The rationel for putting all cryptographic data up front is because the
        protocol requires using a fixed block size for all user data to enable seeking in the chunked stream.</t>
      </section>

       <section anchor="examples" title="Examples">
      <t>Here are some examples of chunked Names using the Labeled Content
      Identifier URI scheme in human readable form (ccnx:).  </t>

      <t>In this example,
      the content producer publishes a JPG that takes 4 Chunks.
      The  EndChunkNumber is missing in the first content object (Chunk 0),
      but is known and included when Chunk 1 is published.
      It is omitted in Chunk 2, then appears in Chunk 3, where it is mandatory.</t>

ccnx:/Name=parc/Name=picture.jpg/Chunk=3  EndChunkNumber=3
]]></artwork>
      </figure>

      <t>In this example, the publisher is writing an audio stream that
      ends before expected so the publisher fills empty Content Objects
      out to the maximum
      ChunkNumber, stating the correct EndChunkNumber.  Chunks 4, 5, and
      6 do not contain any new user data.</t>
