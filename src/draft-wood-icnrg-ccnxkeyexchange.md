--- abstract

This document specifies Version 1.0 of the CCNx Key Exchange (CCNxKE) protocol.
The CCNxKE protocol allows two peers to establish a shared, forward-secure key
for secure and confidential communication. The protocol is designed to prevent
eavesdropping, tampering, and message forgery between two peers. It is also
designed to minimize the number of rounds required to establish a shared key.
In the worst case, it requires two RTTs between a consumer and producer to establish
a shared key. In the best case, one RTT is required before sending any application
data. This document outlines how to derive the keys used to encrypt traffic for
a session and shows how session information is exchanged between a consumer
and producer using message encapsulation.

#  Introduction

DISCLAIMER: This is a WIP draft of CCNxKE and has not yet seen rigorous security analysis.

Ephemeral sessions similar to those enabled by TLS 1.3 {{TLS13}},
QUIC {{QUIC}}, and DTLS 1.2 {{DTLS12}} are needed for some
CCN exchanges between consumers and producers. Currently, there does not exist
a standard way to establish these sessions. Thus, the primary goal of
the CCNxKE protocol is to provide privacy and data integrity between two CCN-enabled
peers (e.g., a consumer and producer engaged in session-based communication). It
is built on the CCNx 1.0 protocol and only relies
upon standard Interest and Content Objects as a vehicle for communication.
The CCNxKE protocol is used to bootstrap session-based communication, wherein
traffic is encapsulated and encrypted using symmetric-key cryptography for
transmission between two endpoints (i.e., a consumer and producer). The CCNxKE
protocol enables this form of communication by establishing shared state,
i.e., shared, ephemeral, and forward-secure symmetric keys.
This protocol has the following four main properties:

- Each peer's identity can be authenticated using asymmetric, or
  public key, cryptography (e.g., RSA {{RSA}}, ECDSA {{ECDSA}}, etc.).
  Server authentication is mandatory whereas mutual authentication is
  optional.

- The negotiation of a forward-secure shared secret is protected from
  eavesdroppers and man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.

- The negotiation is reliable: no attacker can modify the
  negotiation communication without being detected by the parties to
  the communication.

- The state of a CCNxKE session can be securely migrated between an endpoint
performing authentication and that which provides content using a "move token."
This allows authentication and authorization to be separated from encryption for
a session, enabling different systems to complete these steps.

Usage of CCNxKE is entirely independent of upper-layer application protocols.
Session-based communication via encapsulation and encryption enables secure,
confidential, and authenticated communication between two peers. One advantage
of this protocol is that it facilitates the creation and use of ephemeral
CCN Interest and Content Objects.

CCNxKE also introduces a new type of cookie based on reverse hash chains {{HASHCHAIN}}
to help limit the amount of significant server work done in response to a client
or consumer Interest. TCP-based protocols, such as TLS {{TLS13}}, use the TCP 3-way handshake
for such proof. UDP-based protocols, such as QUIC {{QUIC}} and DTLS 1.2 {{DTLS12}}, use an
optional session address token or cookie that must be presented by the client (consumer) to
prove ownership of an address during a key exchange procedure. Without source addresses,
our cookie technique ensures that the same entity which requested server information,
e.g., the public configuration data, is the same entity that wishes to complete
a key exchange.

The main contribution of this work is adapting key exchange principles to the pull-based
CCNx communication model. CCNxKE only assumes that a consumer knows a first name prefix
to initiate the key exchange. The first Interest does not need to be a CCNxKE packet — the
producer can signal back to the consumer that it requires CCNxKE before progressing.

This specification does not subsume other ICN-compliant key exchange protocols. Nor
does its existence imply that all encryption in an ICN must be based on sessions.
It was designed specifically to solve the problem of session-based encryption in ICN.

##  Conventions and Terminology

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
"SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 {{RFC2119}}.

The following terms are used:

Consumer/Client: The CCN consumer initiating the CCNxKE key exchange via a first Interest.

Producer/Server: The CCN producer receiving or accepting the CCNxKE key exchange request request Interest.

Sender: An endpoint that originates a message.

Receiver: An endpoint that is receiving messages.

Peer: An endpoint. When discussing a particular endpoint, "peer" refers to the endpoint that is remote to the primary subject of discussion.

Connection: A network path of n >= 1 hops between the consumer and producer.

Endpoint: Either the consumer or producer of the connection.

Handshake: A series of message exchanges between two peers that is used to perform a
task (e.g., perform key exchange and derivation).

Session: An association between a consumer and a producer resulting from a
CCNxKE handshake.

DH: A Diffie Hellman key exchange procedure {{RFC2631}} {{DH}}.

Key Share: One half of the shared-secret provided by one peer performing a DH key exchange.

Forward-secure: The property that compromising any long-term secrets (e.g., cryptographic
keys) does not compromise any session keys derived from those long-term secrets.

CONFIG information: A data structure created by a producer which contains long-term
cryptographic material and associated information needed by a client to initiate a
key-exchange with the producer.

HELLO exchange: An exchange between a consumer and producer wherein the consumer
retrieves the CONFIG information from the producer.

Payload: The payload section of a CCNxMessage as defined in {{CCNxMessages}}.

KEPayload: A payload for information used in the CCNxKE protocol which is a generic
key-value store. The KEPayload is *not* the CCNxMessage payload.

CCNxName: A CCNxName as defined in {{CCNxMessages}}.

Semi-static: Short-term.

Short-term Secret (SS): A secret which is derived from the server's semi-static
DH share and the client's fresh DH share.

Forward-secure Secret (FSK): A secret which is derived from fresh (i.e., generated
on demand at random) DH shares from both the consumer and producer for the given
connection.

HKDF: Hash-based key-derivation function {{RFC5869}}.

#  Goals

The goals of the CCNxKE protocol, in order of priority, are as follows:

1. Cryptographic security: CCNxKE should be used to securely establish a session
and all related shared secrets between two peers. Cryptographic properties of interest
include: (a) forward-secure session key derivation and (b) (state and computational)
denial-of-service prevention at the producer (see {{RFC4987}}) that is no worse than
DTLS 1.2 {{DTLS12}}}. For property (a), different keys (and relevant algorithm
parameters such as IVs) are established for each communication direction, i.e.,
from consumer to producer and producer to consumer. For property (b), we use a new
type of stateless cookie inspired by that of DTLS 1.2.

2. Interoperability: Independent programmers should be able to develop
applications utilizing CCNxKE that can successfully exchange cryptographic
parameters without knowledge of one another's code.

3. Extensibility: CCNxKE seeks to provide a framework into which new public key
and symmetric key methods and algorithms can be incorporated without breaking
backwards compatibility or requiring all clients to implement new functionality.
Moreover, the protocol should be able to support a variety of peer authentication
protocols, e.g., EAP-TLS, EAP-PWD, or a simple challenge-response protocol.

4. Relative efficiency: CCNxKE tries to create sessions with minimal computation,
bandwidth, and message complexity. In particular, it seeks to create sessions with
as few end-to-end round trips as possible, and also provide support for accelerated
session establishment and resumption when appropriate. At most 2 round-trip-times
(RTTs) should be used to establish a session key, with the possibility of 1-RTT
accelerated starts and resumption.

#  Scope

This document and the CCNxKE protocol are influenced by the TLS 1.3 {{TLS13}},
QUIC {{QUIC}}, and DTLS 1.2 {{DTLS12}} protocols.
The reader, however, does not need a detailed understanding of those
protocols to understand this document. Moreover, where appropriate, references
to related protocols are made for brevity and technical clarity. This document
is intended primarily for readers who will be implementing the protocol and for
those doing cryptographic analysis of it. The specification has been written with
this in mind and it is intended to reflect the needs of those two groups.

This document is not intended to supply any details of service definition or
of interface definition, although it does cover select areas of policy as they are
required for the maintenance of solid security.

#  Presentation Language

This document uses a presentation language of remote calls (i.e. packet messages)
similar to the format used by TLS {{TLS13}}.

# CCNxKE Overview

## Connection Establishment Latency

CCNxKE operates in three rounds, where each round requires a single RTT
to complete. The full execution of the protocol therefore requires 2 RTTs
before a session is fully established. The full version is used when consumers
have no a priori information about the producer. An accelerated one round
version is used when the consumer has valid configuration information and a
source cookie from the producer; this variant requires 1 RTT before a session
is established.

## Connection Migration and Resumption

CCN end hosts lack the notion of addresses. Thus, the producer endpoint
for a given execution of the CCNxKE protocol is one which can authoritatively
serve as the owner of a particular namespace. For example, a consumer may wish
to establish a session with a producer who owns the /company/foo namespace.
The specific end host which partakes in the protocol instance is not specified,
by virtue of the fact that all CCNxKE messages are based on well-defined names.
This enables the producer end-host which partakes in the protocol to change
based on the name of the CCNxKE messages. Consequently, to maintain
correctness, it is important that a single execution of the protocol operates
within the same trusted context; this does not mean that the same producer
end-host is required to participate in all three steps of the protocol.
Rather, it means that the end-host responding to a CCNxKE message must be
trusted by the consumer to complete the exchange. CCNxKE is designed to enable
this sort of producer migration.

For example, a consumer may use an initial name like ‘/parc/index.html’ that
works like an IP any cast address and could got to one of several systems.
CCNxKE allows the responding endpoint to include a localized name to ensure
that subsequent messages from the consumer come back to the same producer.
CCNxKE also allows the key exchange peer to securely hand-off the session to a
content producer peer via another name and session token once the client is
authenticated and keying material is exchanged.

## Re-Transmissions, Timeouts, and Replay Prevention

CCNxKE timeouts and retransmissions are handled using the approach in {{RFC6347}}.
One primary difference is that timer values may need to be adjusted (elongated)
due to prefix shifts and the need for a producer to transfer security information
between different machines.

Replay attack prevention is also an optional feature, and if used, MAY be done
using one of the following two approaches at the receiver (producer):

- IPSec AH {{RFC4302}} and ESP {{RFC4303}} style replay detection based on sliding
windows and monotonically increasing sequence numbers for windows. Note that the
sliding window inherently limits the performance of the protocol to the window size,
since only a finite number of messages may be received within a given window (based
on the window size).

- The optimized anti-replay algorithm of {{RFC6479}}.

## Loss Sensitivity

CCNxKE messages are transferred using standard CCN Interest and Content Objects
and are therefore subject to loss as any datagram. This means that traffic
encrypted with keys derived from CCNxKE must be stateless. They cannot depend
on in-order arrival. This problem is solved by two mechanisms: (1) by prohibiting
stream ciphers of any kind and (2) adding sequence numbers to each message that
allow the receiver to identify and use the correct cryptographic state to decrypt
the message. Moreover, sequence numbers permit anti-replay mechanisms similar to
those used in DTLS {{DTLS12}} as mentioned above.

# The CCNxKE Protocol

This section describes the CCNxKE protocol in detail at the message level. The
specific encoding of those messages is given later. CCNxKE could be adapted to
different wire format encodings, such as those used by the NDN protocol.

The following assumptions are made about peers participating in the CCNxKE protocol:

- Consumers know the namespace prefix of the producer for which they wish to
execute the CCNxKE protocol.

- CCNxKE protocol information is carried in a distinguished field outside of the payload of CCN messages.
This is done to distinguish key exchange material with application data in a message.
This is necessary for 0 RTT packets that carry both keying material and application payload.

- CCNxKE does not require any special behavior of intermediate systems to forward packets.

- CCNxKE packets generally should not be cached for significant periods of time,
as use normal protocol methods to limit caching. Part of this is achieved through
the use of consumer-specific nonces in names.

## Round Overview

CCNxKE is composed of three rounds. The purpose of each round is described below.

* Round 1: Perform a bare HELLO exchange to obtain the extensions (parameters) for the
key exchange provided by the producer and a source cookie to prove ownership of
the "source" of the request.

* Round 2: Perform the initial FULL-HELLO exchange to establish a forward-secure
key used for future communication, i.e., Interest and Content Object exchanges in
the context of the newly established session.

* Round 3: Send the first bit of application data and (optionally) transfer
resumption cookie(s) from the producer to the consumer.

Conceptually, there are two secrets established during a single execution
of CCNxKE:

* Static Secret (SS): A secret which is derived in one of two ways: (a) from
the client and server ephemeral key shares and (b) from the server's semi-static
share and the client's ephemeral key share. Keying material derived from SS in option (a)
is not forward secure.

* Ephemeral Secret (ES): A secret which is derived from both the client and server
ephemeral key shares.

Depending on the mode in which CCNxKE is used, these secrets can be established
in a variety of ways. Key derivation details are outlined in Section {{derive}}.

All secrets are derived with the appropriate amount of randomness {{RFC4086}}.
An overview of the messages sent in each of the three rounds to
establish and use these secrets is shown in Figure {{ccnxke-high}} below. This
diagram omits some parts of each message for brevity.

{: #ccnxke-high title="High-level message flow for full CCNxKE protocol with a maximum 2-RTT delay."}

In the following sections, we will describe the format of each round in this
protocol in more detail.

We do not specify the encoding of CCNxKE data sent in Interest and Content Object
payloads. Any viable encoding will suffice, so long as both parties agree
upon the type. For example, the payload could be structured and encoded as
a JSON object, e.g.,

{
    "ClientKeyShare" : 0xaa,
    "SourceCookie" : 0xbb,
    "SourceProof" : 0xbb,
    ...
}

For now, we assume some valid encoding mechanism is used to give structure
to message payloads. Moreover, we assume that these payloads are carried in a
distinguished CCNxKE payload field contained in the Interest and Content Objects.

## Round 1

The purpose of Round 1 is to acquire a cookie to binding the exchange to the
initial consumer and the public configuration information contained in the
ServerConfiguration structure. This information is used in the second round
when performing the actual key exchange. To that end, the format of the Round 1
message is trivial. First, the client issues an Interest with the following name

~~~
    /prefix/random-1
~~~

where random-1 is a randomly generated 64-bit nonce. This interest carries a
KEPayload with the following information:

| HELLO Field | Description | Optional? |
| SourceChallenge | A random value generated to prove ownership of the consumer's "source" | No |

Upon receipt of this interest, the producer responds with a HELLO-REJECT Content Object whose
KEPayload has the following fields:

| HELLO-REJECT Field | Description | Optional? |
| Timestamp | Current server timestamp | No |
| SourceCookie | A cookie that binds the consumer's challenge to the current timestamp | No |
| PinnedPrefix | A new prefix that pins the key exchange to a particular server | Yes |
| ServerConfiguration | The public server configuration information | Yes |
| ServerChallenge | A random value for the consumer to include in its CertificateVerify if the server requires client authentication | Yes |

The Timestamp and SourceCookie are used in Round 2. Their derivation is described later.
If the server provides a PinnedPrefix then the consumer must use this prefix in Round 2
in lieu of the Round 1 name prefix. (This is because the PinnedPrefix identifies a particular
endpoint that is capable of completing the key exchange.)

The ServerConfiguration information is a semi-static catalog of information that consumers may
use to complete future key exchanges with the producer. The fields of the ServerConfiguration
information are shown below.

| ServerConfiguration Field | Description | Optional? |
| KEXS | Supported elliptic-curve key-exchange algorithms | No |
| AEAD | Supported AEAD algorithms | No |
| PUBS | List of public values (for key exchange algorithm) encoded appropriately for the given group | No |
| EXPRY | Expiration timestamp (i.e., longevity of the ServerConfiguration structure) | No |
| VER | Version of the CONFIG structure | Yes |
| CERT | Server certificate | No |
| SIG | Signature produced by the server over the entire ServerConfiguration message | No |

The KEXS is a data structure that enumerates the elliptic curve key-exchange algorithms that
are supported by the producer (see {{QUIC}} for more details). Currently, only the following
curves are supported:

* Curve25519
* P-256

Selection criteria for these curves is given at http://safecurves.cr.yp.to/.

The AEAD structure enumerates the supported AEAD algorithms used for symmetric-key
authenticated encryption after the session has been established. Currently, the
only supported algorithms are:

* AES-GCM-(128,192,256) {{GCM}}: a 12-byte tag is used, where the first four bytes are taken
from the FSK key-derivation step and the last eight are taken from the initial consumer
nonce.

* ChaCha20+Poly1305 {{RFC7539}}.

The key sizes and related parameters are provided with the AEAD tag in the CONFIG
structure.

The PUBS structure contains the public values for the initial key exchange. Both
Curve25519 and P-256 provide their own set of accepted parameters. Thus, the only
values provided here are the random curve elements used in the DH operation.

The EXPRY value is an absolute timestamp that indicates the longevity of the
ServerConfiguration.

The CERT and SIG values contain the server's certificate and a signature generated
over the entire ServerConfiguration field. This signature is generated with the
corresponding private key.

## Round 2

The purpose of Round 2 is to perform the initial FULL-HELLO exchange to establish a
forward-secure key used for future communication. It is assumed that
the consumer already has the ServerConfiguration information that is provided from
the producer in Round 1. It is also assumed that the consumer has a

Moreover, assume that nonce2 is a ephemeral nonce provided by the
producer in Round 1. Then, the consumer issues an Interest with the following name:

~~~
    /prefix/random-2
~~~

and a KEPayload with the following information:

| FULL-HELLO Field | Description | Optional? |
| ClientKeyShare | The client's key share for the key exchange | No |
| SourceCookie |  SourceCookie provided by the server in Round 1 | No |
| SourceProof | The SourceCookie construction proof provided by the client | No |
| Timestamp | The timestamp provided by the server in Round 1 | No |
| ConsumerPrefix | The consumer's prefix that can be used for the producer to send interests to the consumer | Yes |
| PreSharedKey | A pre-shared key that can be configured between a consumer and producer | Yes |
| ResumptionCookie | The ResumptionCookie derived from a past session | Yes |
| {MoveChallenge} | A move challenge generated identically to the SourceChallenge | Yes |
| {AlgChoice} | Algorithm (KEXS and AEAD) options choice (a list of tags echoed from the ServerConfiguration) | No |
| {Proof} | Proof of demand (i.e., a sorted list of types of proof the consumer will expect) | No |
| {CCS} | Compressed certificate set that the consumer possesses | No |
| {ConsumerData} | Application data encrypted under a key derived from SS (in a 1-RTT exchange) | Yes |
| ServerNameIndication | A server name indication (as a CCNxName) defined in Section 3 of {{RFC6066}} | Yes |
| Certificate | The client's certificate | Yes |
| CertificateVerify | A signature generated over the entire FULL-HELLO message | Yes |

((TODO: provide more details about each of these fields))

Upon receipt of this interest, the producer performs the DH computation
to compute ES and SS, decrypts all protected fields in the consumer's KEPayload, and validates the
algorithm choice selection (AlgChoice). If any of these steps fail, the producer
replies with with a HELLO-REJECT Content Object whose KEPayload contains
a REJ flag and the reason of the error. The REJ flag and value are encrypted
by the SS (if possible).

If the above steps complete without failure or error, then the producer responds with a
Content Object whose KEPayload has the following fields:

| HELLO-ACCEPT Field | Description | Optional? |
| SessionID | Cleartext session identifier | No |
| ServerKeyShare | Server's key share for the ES derivation | No |
| {ServerExtensions} | Additional extensions provided by the server, encrypted under ES | Yes |
| [ResumptionCookie] | Resumption cookie encrypted under a TS-derived key | Yes |
| {(MovePrefix,MoveToken)} | Third CCNxName prefix and token to use when moving to session establishment | Yes |
| CertificateRequest* | Server certificate that matches the type of proof provided by the client | Yes |
| CertificateVerify* | Signature generated over the entire HELLO-ACCEPT message | Yes |

If a MovePrefix and MoveToken tuple is provided then in the HELLO-ACCEPT message then
a CertificateVerify (signature) MUST also be provided in the response.

## Round 3

In Round 3, the consumer sends interests whose name and optional Payload are
encrypted using one of the forward-secure keys derived after Round 2. In normal operation,
the producer will respond with Content Objects whose Payloads are encrypted using
a different forward-secure key. That is, interests and Content Objects are encrypted
and authenticated using two separate keys. The producer may also optionally provide
a new resumption cookie (RC) with a Content Object response. This is used to keep
the consumer's resumption cookie fresh and to also support 0 RTT resumption. In this
case, the producer's Content Object response has the following fields:

* Payload: the actual Content Object payload data encrypted with the producer's
forward-secure key.

* ResumptionCookie: A new resumption cookie to be used for resuming this session in the future.

The producer is free to choose the frequency at which new resumption cookies are
issued to the consumer.

The producer may also reply with a new SessionID. This is done if the client presented
a MoveToken and MoveProof. A NewSessionID must be accompanied with a NewSessionIDTag,
which is equal to the HMAC of NewSessionID computed with the traffic-secret key.
A client MUST then use NewSessionID instead of SessionID after verifying the
NewSessionIDTag.

# Alternative Exchanges

CCNxKE also supports one-round key exchange and session resumption. These variants
are outlined below. The key material differences are described later. In these
variants, we use message ExchangeSourceCookie to denote the following exchange:

# Secret Derivation {#derive}

In this section we describe how secrets used in the protocol are derived.
We cover the SourceCookie, MoveToken, SessionID, ResumptionCookie, and the
actual traffic keys.

## SourceCookie Derivation

The intention of the SourceCookie is to prove that a client is sending interests
from a legitimate location before any server computation is done. Without this,
a Denial of Service attack could be carried out by sending interests to the server
with the intention of triggering wasted computation. TCP-based protocols prevent
this with the SYN-flood cookie mechanism. Protocols based on UDP use cookies that
bind to the client address {{DTLS12}}. Since CCN lacks any notion of a source address,
these cookie mechanisms do not apply. Instead, we need a way for clients to prove
that they initiated a key exchange from the "same origin." We now describe the cookie
mechanism that gives us this guarantee.

Instead of a source address, a SourceCookie is computed using a challenge provided
by a consumer. To create this challenge, a consumer first generates a a randomly
generated 256-bit string X. The consumer then computes SourceChallenge = SHA256(X).
Upon receipt of this challenge, the producer generates a SourceCookie as follows:

    SourceCookie = HMAC(k, SourceChallenge || timestamp)

where timestamp is the current server timestamp and k is the server's secret key.
To prove ownership of the "source," the consumer then provides the SourceCookie
and a SourceProof in the round 2 Interest. The SourceProof is set to the value X
used to derive the SourceChallenge. Upon receipt of the SourceProof, the server
verifies the following equality:

    SourceCookie = HMAC(k, SHA256(SourceProof) || timestamp)

If this check passes, then the server continues with the computationally expensive
part of the key exchange protocol.

To avoid replays of the SourceProof and SourceCookie, a producer SHOULD keep a sliding
window of previously received tuples.

## Move Derivation

The MoveChallenge and MoveProof are computed identically to the SourceChallenge
and SourceProof. The MoveToken, however, is left as an opaque bit string. Extensions
may be specified to describe how to compute this value.

## SessionID and ResumptionCookie Properties, Derivation, and Usage

The purpose of the session identifier SessionID is to uniquely
identify a single session for the producer and consumer. A Producer MAY use
a random bit string or MAY use the method described in this section or MAY
use another proprietary method to distinguish clients.

We provide a more secure creation of the SessionID since it is used
with the ResumptionCookie derivation (defined later). Specifically,
the SessionID is derived as the encryption of the hash digest of a server
secret, TS, and an optional prefix (e.g., MovePrefix).

Encryption is done by the using a long-term secret key owned by the server used
for only this purpose, i.e., it is not used for consumer traffic encryption.
Mechanically, this derivation is:

    SessionID = Enc(k1, H(TS || (Prefix3))),

where k1 is the long-term producer key.

For the resumption cookie, we require that it must be able to be used to
recover the TS for a given session. Without TS, correct session communication
is not possible. We derive it as the encryption of the hash digest
of the server secret, TS, and the optional (MovePrefix, MoveToken) tuple
(if created for the session). The producer must use a long-term secret key
for this encryption. Mechanically, this derivation is:

    ResumptionCookie = Enc(k2, TS || ( (Prefix3 || MoveToken) )),

where k2 is again a long-term producer key. Note that it may be the case that
k1 = k2 (see above), though this is not required.

With this SessionID and ResumptionCookie, the consumer then resumes a session by providing
both the SessionID and ResumptionCookie to the producer. This is done to prove to the producer that
the consumer who knows the SessionID is also in possession of the correct ResumptionCookie.
The producer verifies this by computing

    (TS || ( (Prefix3 || MoveToken) )) = Dec(k2, ResumptionCookie)

and checking the following equality

    SessionID = Enc(k1, H(TS || (Prefix3)))

If equality holds, the producer uses the TS recovered from ResumptionCookie to
re-initialize the previous session with the consumer.

## Key Derivation

CCNxKE adopts the key schedule and derivation techniques defined in TLS 1.3 {{TLS13}}.
Specifically, it uses the SS and ES to establish a common master secret (MS) and,
from that, the traffic secret (TS). These dependencies are shown below.

~~~
+------+           +------+
| KE-1 |           | KE-2 |
+------+           +----+-+
    |                   |
    |                   |
    |                   |
+---v--+           +----v-+
|  SS  +---+    +--+  ES  |
+------+   |    |  +------+
           |    |
           |    |
         +-v----v-|
         |   MK   |
         +---+----+
             |
             |
             |
           +-v--+
           | TS |
           +----+
~~~

In this figure, KE-1 and KE-2 are two "sources" of keying material. The following
table shows what these two sources are in different key exchange scenarios.

| Key Exchange | KE-1 | KE-2 |
| Full handshake | ClientKeyShare and ServerKeyShare DH | ClientKeyShare and ServerKeyShare DH |
| Handshake with 1-RTT | ClientKeyShare and ServerConfiguration public share DH | ClientKeyShare and ServerKeyShare DH |
| PSK | Pre-shared key | Pre-shared key |

Given the values for SS and ES, the remaining derivation steps are below as defined in {{TLS13}}.
They are repeated here for posterity.

1. xSS = HKDF-Extract(0, SS). Note that HKDF-Extract always produces a value the
    same length as the underlying hash function.

2. xES = HKDF-Extract(0, ES)

3. mSS = HKDF-Expand-Label(xSS, "expanded static secret",
                                handshake_hash, L)

4. mES = HKDF-Expand-Label(xES, "expanded ephemeral secret",
                                handshake_hash, L)

5. master_secret = HKDF-Extract(mSS, mES)

6. traffic_secret_0 = HKDF-Expand-Label(master_secret, "traffic secret", handshake_hash, L)

In all computations, the value "handshake_hash" is defined as the SHA256 hash
digest of all CCNxKE messages contained up to the point of derivation. More details
are given in Section 7.3.1 of {{TLS13}}.

Updating the traffic secret using the re-key message (defined later) increments
traffic_secret_N to traffic_secret_(N+1). This update procedure works as follows:

traffic_secret_N+1 = HKDF-Expand-Label(traffic_secret_N, "traffic
                                        secret", "", L)

## Secret Generation and Lifecycle

The secrets (keys and IVs) used to encrypt and authenticate traffic are derived from the traffic
secret. The explicit derivation formula, as is defined in {{TLS13}}, is as follows:

secret = HKDF-Expand-Label(Secret, phase + ", " + purpose, handshake_context, key_length)

In this context, secret can be a key or IV.
This formula is used when deriving keys based on a non-forward-secure SS and
the forward-secure TS. The following table enumerates the values for "phase",
and "handshake_context" to be used when defining keys for different purposes.

| Record Type | Secret | Phase | Handshake Context |
| 1-RTT Handshake | xSS | "early handshake key expansion" | HELLO + ServerConfiguration + Server Certificate |
| 1-RTT Data | xSS | "early application data key expansion" | HELLO + ServerConfiguration + Server Certificate |
| Application Data | TS | "application data key expansion" | HELLO ... Finished |

Moreover, the following table indicates the values of "purpose" used in the
generation of each secret.

| Secret | Purpose |
| Client Write Key | "client write key" |
| Server Write Key | "server write key" |
| Client Write IV  | "client write IV"  |
| Server Write IV  | "server write IV"  |

(( TODO: should we add examples for each of the above variants? ))

# Re-Key Message

Either the client and server can trigger a key update by sending an Interest or
Content Object with a KEPayload field containing the flag KeyUpdate. The KEPayload
will be encrypted by the traffic key. Upon receipt, the recipient MUST update the
traffic secret as defined above and re-compute the traffic encryption and authentication
keys. The previous traffic key must be securely discarded.

# Application Data Protocol

Once traffic keys and the associated IVs are derived from the CCNxKE protocol,
all subsequent Interest and Content Object messages are encrypted. Packet encryption
uses the TLV encapsulation mechanism specified in {{ESIC}}. For Interest
encryption, the Salt in {{ESIC}} is set to the packet sequence number.
The same substitution is done for Content Object encryption. Similarly, the
KeyId field is substituted with the SessionID derived by the CCNxKE protocol.
Packet sequence numbers are 64-bit numbers initialized to 0 when after the
traffic secret is calculated. Each message increments and uses the sequence
number when sending a new datagram (Interest). The sequence number for an Interest
matches that of the Content Object response.

# Security Considerations

For CCNxKE to be able to provide a secure connection, both the consumer and producer
systems, keys, and applications must be secure. In addition, the implementation
must be free of security errors.

The system is only as strong as the weakest key exchange and authentication
algorithm supported, and only trustworthy cryptographic functions should be
used. Short public keys and anonymous servers should be used with great
caution. Implementations and users must be careful when deciding which
certificates and certificate authorities are acceptable; a dishonest
certificate authority can do tremendous damage.
