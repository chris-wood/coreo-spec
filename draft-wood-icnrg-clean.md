--- abstract

This document specifies CCNx CLEAN -- content-locked encryption and
authentication of nameless objects -- as a way of enabling encrypted
and naturally de-duplicated content in CCN. CLEAN builds on the
FLIC Manifest to convey the encryption information necessary to
decrypt nameless content objects encapsulated within a Manifest.
As a result, CLEAN encrypts nameless content objects *by default*
without any application-layer input.

#  Introduction

In CCN, nameless objects are content objects which do not carry a Name TLV field.
Thus, a necessary requisite to retrieve them from the network is to know their
respective ContentObjectHashRestriction (or ContentId). A ContentId is the cryptographic
hash of a packet. A router may only forward a nameless content object if its
cryptographic hash digest matches that which is specified in the ContentId of
the corresponding request.

Manifests are network-level structures used to convey ContentIds to consumers so that
they may request nameless content objects. These are necessary since a consumer cannot
obtain the ContentId of a nameless content object which it has not yet retrieved.
Manifests are typically used to group segments of a single, large piece of data
under a common name. For example, imagine the consumer wishes to obtain the data named
/foo/bar, which has a total size well beyond the 64KB limit imposed by the CCN packet
format. To transfer /foo/bar efficiently, the producer segments the /foo/bar data
into fixed size chunks and, for each chunk, creates a nameless content object. Then,
the producer creates a Manifest with the name /foo/bar which contains the references
to each of these constituent nameless object parts. To fetch /foo/bar, a consumer then
(a) issues a request for the name /foo/bar, (b) receives, verifies, and parses the
Manifest, and (c) subsequently issues requests for each nameless content object
using the provided ContentIds. (See {{CCNxSemantics}} for more details.)
The {{FLIC}} data structure is one type of CCN Manifest data structure.

By default, the data contained inside each nameless content object is unencrypted.
If confidentiality is required, the producer application must explicitly encrypt
the data prior to transfer. This situation is not ideal. To improve this baseline
scenario, we introduce CCNx CLEAN -- content-locked encryption and authentication
of nameless objects. CLEAN builds on recent advances in message-locked encryption ({{MLE}})
to encrypt nameless objects by default without invalidating their natural de-duplication
properties.

##  Conventions and Terminology

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
"SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 {{RFC2119}}.

The following terms are used:

Nameless object: A CCN content object packet which contain a Name TLV field.

# CLEAN Crypto

CLEAN only relies on MLE, which is a form of encryption by which the encryption key
for a message is derived from the message itself. For example, a message M
may be encrypted by a key K = H(M), where H is a suitable cryptographic hash function
for use in MLE constructions. The encryption of M is thus computed as M' = Enc(H(M), M),
where Enc is a symmetric-key encryption algorithm suitable for MLE.
This procedure is deterministic; two equal messages will be encrypted to the same
ciphertext value. As a result, MLE supports natural de-duplication of data based on
ciphertext equality.

# CLEAN End Host Support

Let D be a piece of data for which a producer P would normally
create a Manifest with name N. Let C_1,...,C_n be the n nameless content
objects created from D. The CLEAN construction works as follows:

1. P computes k = KDF(H(D)), where KDF is any suitable key derivation function.
2. For each C_i in C_1,...,C_n, P derives k_i = KDF(k || i) uses it to compute
C_i' = Enc(k, C_i).
3. From C_1',...,C_n', P creates the manifest M(N) as per the {{FLIC}} specification.
4. P inserts H(D) into the root node of M(N). (This is described in the following section.)

# FLIC Support

The {{FLIC}} format already includes the metadata value OverallDataDigest. For
a given FLIC node N, this value corresponds to H(D), where D is the array of
application data in the nameless content objects contained in N. Therefore,
CLEAN does not require any changes in the FLIC format.

# Use Cases

Since the data digest (i.e., H(D)) is contained in the root manifest, the confidentiality
of nameless content objects reduces to that of the root manifest. This has the following
benefits:

1. If access control to D is needed, P need only apply the necessary access control scheme
to the root manifest so that H(D) is not leaked.
2. If D is public data that a consumer Cr wishes to retrieve anonymously, the root manifest
can be requested over a secure, ephemeral session between Cr and P. One way to establish
such a channel is with {{CCNxKE}}.

In both cases, the nameless content objects that carry segments of D remain protected
without applying any type of access control to them individually.

# Security Considerations

The CLEAN security model depends on the root manifest being protected either at rest
or, optionally, in transit. If the root is protected at rest via some access control
mechanism, then CLEAN remains secure in the MLE model. MLE security also holds if the
root is encrypted only in transit over a secure session,
